/**
 * @file memory_allocation.c
 * 
 * @brief C provides some functions to achieve these tasks. There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are:
 * * malloc()
 * * calloc()
 * * realloc()
 * * free()
 *
 * The `malloc` function, or memory allocation, is used to dynamically allocate, at runtime, a single large block of memory with the specified size. It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. It doesnâ€™t Initialize memory at execution time so that it has initialized each block with the default garbage value initially.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```C
 * cast-type *ptr;
 * ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(offset * byte-size);
 * ```
 *
 * The `calloc` function, or contiguous allocation, is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type. It initializes each block with a default value `0`.
 *
 * Example:
 * Here, **n** is the no. of elements and **element-size** is the size of each element.
 * ```C
 * cast-type *ptr;
 * ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);
 * ```
 *
 * The `realloc` function, or reallocation, is used to dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory. In other words, if the memory previously allocated with the help of malloc or calloc is insufficient, realloc can be used to dynamically re-allocate memory. This function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory. If the memory is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a NULL pointer.
 * It maintains the already present value and new blocks will be initialized with a garbage value.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```C
 * cast-type *ptr;
 * ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize);
 * ```
 *
 * The `free` function, or deallocation, is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. The memory allocated using functions malloc, calloc, or realloc is not de-allocated on their own. Hence the free() method is used, whenever the dynamic memory allocation is no longer needed.
